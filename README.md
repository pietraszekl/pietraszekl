### Hi, I'm Łukasz (pronounced: woo-ca$h) 👋
I build front-end for e-commerce sites such as Gucci, Arsenal FC and Delhaize just to name few.

Currently I'm working for KPS UK were we develop B2C site for well known beauty brand using [SAP Spartacus (Angular 8+)](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/) and [SAP CX (Hybris)](https://cx.sap.com/en/products/commerce).
